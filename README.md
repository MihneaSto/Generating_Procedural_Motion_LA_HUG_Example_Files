# Generating_Procedural_Motion_LA_HUG_Example_Files
Sharing a simple example file showcasing the workflow that I showed at the LA HUG talk about CHOPs and procedural motion in Houdini.
Both Apprentice, non-commercial, and Indie, limited commercial, versions are available.

The mech example that I showed at the LA HUG was part of my university project so I can not share that scene. I chose to upload the Tommy Hands example becasue I think that it covers quite well everything that I touched upon at the HUG. In terms of motion, I built a very simple example but it should get the idea across. I encourage you to deconstruct the scene and then try out your own ideas and set ups. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send me an email at mihneahio@gmail.com
