# Generating_Procedural_Motion_LA_HUG_Example_Files
Sharing a simple example file showcasing the workflow that I showed at the LA HUG talk about CHOPs and procedural motion in Houdini.
Both Apprentice, non-commercial, and Indie, limited commercial, versions are available.

I chose to upload the Tommy Hands example because I think that it covers everything that I touched upon at the HUG quite well. In terms of motion, I built a very simple example that should get the idea across. I encourage you to deconstruct the scene and then try out your own ideas and set ups. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send me an email at mihneahio@gmail.com or a message on twitter at @stoica_mihnea

Thank you for stopping by!
